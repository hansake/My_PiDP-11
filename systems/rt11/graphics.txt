1. Window sizes with scale=1: VR14 1024x768, VR17 1024x1024, VR48 1024x1024
2. Win mode. FULL = use whole screen with no borders eg a 1024x768 monitor is perfect for a VR14. NORM = a normal window with a title and border.
3. Scale mode. These are division factors. ie with scale-2 and CRT=VR17 the window will be 512x512. Scale 4 and 8 are not very useful. (Then you can have a terminal on screen as well).
4. I hope the others are fairly obvious.
5. As we are using SDL2, the window is always on display :0 (the Pi). But, you can have a remote display with RealVNC ... not bad either!
6. The VS60 mode is selected with:
set vt crt=vr48
set vt scale=1
set vs60 enable
set vs60 vector=320
This can be used with RT11/Lunar lander as well but, I haven't managed to find any VS60 specific software as yet.
Try it, the phosphor setting is quite pretty!
5. I have a build of the Fortran graphic libraries for RT11 and RSX11. If anyone want a copy, let me know. (See http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/dec/graphics/VT11/FtnGfxPkg_FortranRef.pdf) (This was really hard, ODT and everything!)
